# Fractal Fern
This a program written in javascript which uses the ideas presented wonderfully in a book I bought 29 years ago called "Fractals Everwhere" by Micheal Barnsley (1988 ISBN 0-12-079062-9). 
The output from running fern.html on a browser is given in fern.png.
Adapted the code to plot in a SVG (using D3.js) rather than a Canvas. This is much slower.
